camel: [
`1. Kneel with body upright and hips stacked over the knees. Take padding (a blanket or fold your mat so it is double thickness) under your knees if they are sensitive. 

2. Draw your hands up the side of your body until your palms reach the sides of your rib cage. Let your thumbs rest on the back of the ribs as the other four fingers wrap around the sides and fronts of the rib cage with elbows pointing out. With this grip, use your hands to lift the rib cage up for support as you start to open your chest toward the ceiling.

3. Maintain the position of your chest as you reach your hands back one at a time to grasp your heels. If you need a little more height, tuck your toes under. Otherwise, the tops of the feet can be flat on the floor.

4. Bring your hips forward so that they stay over your knees.

5. If it feels good, let your head come back, opening your throat. If that doesnt work for your neck you can keep the chin tucked instead.`,

chair: [
`1. Bend your knees until the thighs are almost parallel to the floor. The feet should be parallel. If your feet are touching, keep your knees together. If your feet are slightly separated thats OK but make sure your knees are separated the same amount.

2. Brush your fingertips against the floor to make sure that you are getting really low.

3. Keep your knees bent and your butt low as you lift your arms up.`,

cobra: [
`1. Place your palms flat on the ground directly under your shoulders. Bend your elbows straight back and hug them into your sides.

3. Inhale to lift your chest off the floor. Roll your shoulders back and keep your low ribs on the floor. Make sure your elbows continue hugging your sides. Dont let them wing out to either side.
    
4. Keep your neck neutral. Dont crank it up. Your gaze should stay on the floor.`,

triangle: [
`1. Engage your right thigh muscles and draw your right femur into its socket. Extend your right hand toward the front of the room, keeping your right hip tucked.
 
2. Lower your right hand down, onto your shin or ankle. If you are more open, bring your right hand to the floor on the inside or on the right foot. Do whichever one feels most comfortable.

3. The left shoulder stacks on top of the right one as you open your chest, reaching your left fingertips toward the ceiling while keeping your left shoulder rooted in its socket. 

4. Turn your head to take your gaze up toward your left fingertips. If this is uncomfortable for your neck its also fine to keep the head in a more neutral position. 

5. Continue to draw your right thigh muscles upward, deepening the crease in your right hip.

6. Soften your right knee slightly to prevent hyperextension.`,

goddess_pose: [
`1. From a standing position with the feet 3 feet apart, bend the elbows at shoulder height and turn the palms facing each other. Turn the feet out 45 degrees facing the corners of the room, and as you exhale bend the knees over the toes squatting down.

2. Press the hips forward, press the knees back. Drop the shoulders down and back and press the chest toward the front of the room. Keep the arms active, as if they were holding a big ball over your head. Look straight ahead with the chin parallel to the floor.`,

plank: [
`1. From Standing Forward Fold, step or jump both feet back 4-5 feet into a push-up position.

2. Spread the fingers wide apart with the middle finger pointing forward, press into the palms with the arms are straight. Tuck the tailbone under so the legs, hips and torso are one straight line. Press the crown of the head forward and with the toes tucked, press the heels back.`,

tree: [
`1. Take a moment to feel both your feet root into the floor, your weight distributed equally on all four corners of each foot.

2. Begin to shift your weight into your right foot, lifting your left foot off the floor. Keep your right leg straight but don't lock the knee.

3. Bend your left knee and bring the sole of your left foot high onto your inner right thigh.

4. Press your foot into your thigh and your thigh back into your foot with equal pressure. This will help you keep both hips squared toward the front so your right hip doesn't jut out.

5. Focus your gaze on something that doesn't move to help you keep your balance.`,

upward_dog: [
`1. As your body approaches the ground, inhale to straighten your arms as you roll over your toes, changing your foot position from toes tucked under to resting on the tops of your feet. If you can't roll over your toes, it's fine to flip them one at a time. Dont bring your thighs to the floor during the transition if you can help it.

2. Open your chest toward the ceiling as you straighten your arms. Your gaze will go up slightly but its not necessary to throw your head back.

3. Keep your legs engaged and drop your hips toward the floor. The only things touching the floor are the palms of your hands and the tops of your feet. Push strongly into both.

4. Keep your shoulders over your wrists and draw your shoulder blades down and toward your spine to create space between your shoulders and your ears.`,
